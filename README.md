I've added a section on how to install an unpacked extension for Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and mentioned that other browsers should be installed following their specific documentation.

## Todo

- [ ] add icon
- [ ] fix `manifest.json` (with all parameters like author blablabla)
